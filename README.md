# Fit - A Figma Plugin
## Resize objects to fit their parent container
Fit is a small, very simple, utility plugin for Figma that resizes an object or objects to fill up (or fit) their parent's width, height, or both.

Fit currently works with shapes, text layers, and frames within frames, groups, or booleans.
